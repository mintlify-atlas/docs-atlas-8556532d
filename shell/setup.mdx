description: Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion for bash, zsh, and fish
---

fzf provides powerful shell integration features including key bindings (CTRL-T, CTRL-R, ALT-C) and fuzzy completion. This guide covers the setup process for bash, zsh, and fish shells.

## Quick Setup

The easiest way to set up shell integration is using fzf's built-in commands:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bash">
    Add this line to your `~/.bashrc`:

    ```bash
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    eval "$(fzf --bash)"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Zsh">
    Add this line to your `~/.zshrc`:

    ```zsh
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    source <(fzf --zsh)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Fish">
    Add this line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

    ```fish
    # Set up fzf key bindings
    fzf --fish | source
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
The `--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are only available in fzf 0.48.0 or later.
</Note>

## Manual Setup (Advanced)

For finer control or older fzf versions, you can source individual script files from the `/shell` directory. The location varies by package manager:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bash">
    ```bash
    # Key bindings
    source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/key-bindings.bash
    
    # Fuzzy completion
    source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/completion.bash
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Zsh">
    ```zsh
    # Key bindings
    source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/key-bindings.zsh
    
    # Fuzzy completion
    source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/completion.zsh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Fish">
    ```fish
    # Key bindings and completion
    source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/key-bindings.fish
    source /usr/share/doc/fzf/examples/completion.fish
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Tip>
Use `apt show fzf` or your package manager's equivalent to find the exact file locations.
</Tip>

## Disabling Specific Key Bindings

You can disable individual key bindings by setting the corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string **before** sourcing the script:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bash">
    ```bash
    # Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C, keep CTRL-T
    FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval "$(fzf --bash)"
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Zsh">
    ```zsh
    # Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C, keep CTRL-T
    FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Fish">
    ```fish
    # Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C, keep CTRL-T
    fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
Setting the variables **after** sourcing the script will have no effect. They must be set before or during the sourcing process.
</Warning>

## Verifying Installation

After setting up shell integration, restart your shell or source your configuration file:

```bash
# Reload configuration
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc or ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Test the key bindings:
- Press `CTRL-T` to search for files
- Press `CTRL-R` to search command history
- Press `ALT-C` to change directory
