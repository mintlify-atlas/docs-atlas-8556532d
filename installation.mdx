description: Install fzf on macOS, Linux, Windows, and other platforms using various package managers
---

## Overview

fzf is distributed as a single portable binary with no dependencies, making installation straightforward on any platform. Choose the method that works best for your system.

<Note>
  After installing fzf, you'll need to set up shell integration separately to enable key bindings (CTRL-T, CTRL-R, ALT-C) and fuzzy completion. See the [Shell Integration](#setting-up-shell-integration) section below.

## Installation Methods

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    ### Using Homebrew
    
    The recommended way to install fzf on macOS:
    
    ```bash
    brew install fzf
    ```
    
    ### Using MacPorts
    
    Alternatively, you can use MacPorts:

## Using Git

For the most complete installation with automatic shell integration setup:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clone the repository">
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.git ~/.fzf
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Run the install script">
    ```bash
    ~/.fzf/install
    ```
    
    The install script will:
    - Download or build the fzf binary
    - Add fzf to your `$PATH`
    - Set up shell integration for key bindings and fuzzy completion
    - Update your shell configuration files (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart your shell">
    ```bash
    # For bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    
    # For zsh
    source ~/.zshrc
    
    # Or simply restart your terminal
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  The install script accepts several options:
  
  ```bash
  # Download binary only, skip shell configuration
  ~/.fzf/install --bin
  
  # Enable all features (key bindings + completion)
  ~/.fzf/install --all
  
  # Disable specific features
  ~/.fzf/install --no-key-bindings
  ~/.fzf/install --no-completion
  
  # Use XDG base directory
  ~/.fzf/install --xdg
  ```
</Tip>

## Binary Releases

You can download pre-built binaries directly from the releases page:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Download the binary">
    Visit [https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases) and download the appropriate binary for your platform:
    
    - `fzf-0.68.0-darwin_amd64.tar.gz` - macOS (Intel)
    - `fzf-0.68.0-darwin_arm64.tar.gz` - macOS (Apple Silicon)

  <Step title="Extract and install">
    ```bash
    # Extract the archive
    tar -xzf fzf-0.68.0-linux_amd64.tar.gz
    
    # Make it executable
    chmod +x fzf
    
    # Move to a directory in your PATH
    sudo mv fzf /usr/local/bin/
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up shell integration">
    Continue to the [Shell Integration](#setting-up-shell-integration) section below.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting up Shell Integration

Shell integration provides:
- **CTRL-T**: Paste the selected files and directories onto the command-line
- **CTRL-R**: Paste the selected command from history onto the command-line
- **ALT-C**: cd into the selected directory
- **Fuzzy completion** for files, directories, processes, and more

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Bash">
    Add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`:
    
    ```bash
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    eval "$(fzf --bash)"
    ```
    
    Then reload your configuration:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Zsh">
    Add the following line to your `~/.zshrc`:
    
    ```zsh
    # Set up fzf key bindings and fuzzy completion
    source <(fzf --zsh)
    ```
    
    Then reload your configuration:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Fish">
    Add the following line to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:
    
    ```fish
    # Set up fzf key bindings
    fzf --fish | source
    ```
    
    Then reload your configuration:
    
    ```bash
    source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  The `--bash`, `--zsh`, and `--fish` options are available in fzf 0.48.0 or later. If you have an older version, you'll need to source individual script files from the `/shell` directory. Check your package documentation for the exact file locations (e.g., `apt show fzf`).
</Note>

### Disabling Specific Key Bindings

You can disable CTRL-T, CTRL-R, or ALT-C bindings by setting the corresponding `*_COMMAND` variable to an empty string:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Bash
# Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C
FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= eval "$(fzf --bash)"
```

```zsh Zsh
# Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C
FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source <(fzf --zsh)
```

```fish Fish
# Disable CTRL-R and ALT-C
fzf --fish | FZF_CTRL_R_COMMAND= FZF_ALT_C_COMMAND= source
```
</CodeGroup>

<Warning>
  You must set these variables **before** sourcing the script. Setting them afterward will have no effect.
</Warning>

## Upgrading fzf

Upgrade fzf using the same method you used to install it:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Homebrew
brew update && brew upgrade fzf
```

```bash MacPorts
sudo port upgrade fzf
```

```bash APT (Debian/Ubuntu)
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade fzf
```

```bash Git
cd ~/.fzf && git pull && ./install
```

```bash Chocolatey
choco upgrade fzf
```

```vim Vim-plug
:PlugUpdate fzf
```
</CodeGroup>

## Building from Source

If you want to build fzf from source or contribute to development, see [BUILD.md](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/BUILD.md) in the repository.

## Vim/Neovim Plugin

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), add this to your Vim configuration:

```vim
Plug 'junegunn/fzf', { 'do': { -> fzf#install() } }
Plug 'junegunn/fzf.vim'
```

- `junegunn/fzf` provides the basic library functions
- `fzf#install()` ensures you have the latest binary
- `junegunn/fzf.vim` is a separate project that provides useful commands

<Tip>
  If you use Neovim and prefer Lua-based plugins, check out [fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua).
</Tip>

For more details on Vim integration, see [README-VIM.md](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README-VIM.md).

## Verification

Verify your installation:

```bash
fzf --version
```

You should see output like:

```
0.68.0 (devel)
```

## Next Steps

Now that fzf is installed, continue to the [Quick Start](/quickstart) guide to learn how to use it effectively.
